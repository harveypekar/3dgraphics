A quick collection of things that don't fit in the slides/class.

## Installing unity

[The official website](https://unity.com/download) is your first stop. The process is twofold : you install the Unity Hub (which unfortunately needs a login), and you use the hub to install a specific engine. You know you're done when you can make a new project in the Unity Hub, and launch the editor.

## IDE intergration

The Unity editor runs our program for us most of the time. That means we need to do some extra steps to enable a debugger to work with it, or to have decent auto complete. Two solutions are provided: one for Visual Studio Code, and one for Visual Studio.

Unsure of the difference or what to use?

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the basic cross-platform IDE you all know and maybe love. Visual Studio is a completely different program (Microsoft is great at naming). It's a very big and complicated IDE geared towards .NET (including C#, the language we will be using) and C++(which you will be spared from). [The community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is free to install.

Picking one is easy. If you're on Windows, I highly recommend you give it a try. If you aren't, or you don't want to, use vscode. You can use other editors (such as xcode), but I won't be able to provide support.

### Visual Studio Code

[This guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity) should be all you need. You'll need to learn how to make a unity script and run it before you can test that your debugger works.

[This guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VisualStudioIntegration.html) should be all you need. You'll need to learn how to make a unity script and run it before you can test that your debugger works.

## Unity Tutorials

### Junior Programmer

An interesting set of tutorials is [the junior programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer). Some of the coding parts might be a bit slow, but don't let that stop you from completing tutorials. They're about 60% relevant.

[Unit 1 - Player Control](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&contentId=5f7229b2edbc2a001f834db7)

[Unit 2 - Basic Gameplay](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-2-basic-gameplay?pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0)

### C#

One student has recommended [this tutorial](https://unity.com/how-to/learning-c-sharp-unity-beginners) for scripting in Unity

### Minecraft 

[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h66IN1Pndd0&list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWEJ-5eMtXsYp03Y9yF1dEn&pp=iAQB) covers a lot of the practical part of this course, and has been used with success by a lot of students in the previous years.

DISCLAIMER. Please don't mistake this course for following this tutorial. It's expected of you to implement your own solutions, and understand them. The requirements of this course are also different of what is implemented in the tutorial. In short, use it to learn how to implement your own. Don't follow it to retroactively try to fit it into the requirements.
